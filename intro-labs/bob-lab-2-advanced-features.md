## BobShell Fundamentals

### What is BobShell?

BobShell is Bob's command-line interface that brings AI assistance to:

- **Terminal workflows**: Chat with Bob directly from the command line
- **Automation scripts**: Integrate Bob into shell scripts
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Use Bob in build and deployment processes
- **Batch operations**: Process multiple files or tasks in sequence
- **Remote environments**: Use Bob on servers without a GUI

> **🧠 Bob Differentiator: Intelligent Resource Optimization**
>
> BobShell automatically selects the most appropriate AI model for each task. Simple operations use lighter models for speed, while complex analysis uses frontier-class models for accuracy. This happens transparently, reducing costs by up to 60% while maintaining quality.

### Installation and Setup

**Verify BobShell Installation:**

```bash
# Check BobShell version
bob --version

# View available commands
bob --help
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob CLI v1.x.x
Usage: bob [options] [command]
...
```

**If you see "command not found":**
- Follow the [BobShell installation guide](https://bob.ibm.com/docs/shell/getting-started/install-and-setup)
- Verify Bob is in your system PATH
- Restart your terminal after installation

## BobShell in Practice

### Interactive Mode

Launch Bob in interactive mode for terminal-based conversations:

```bash
# Start interactive session
bob
```

**Try these commands:**

```
# Ask for explanations
> Explain what a closure is in JavaScript

# Generate code
> Create a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers

# Get help with errors
> Why would I get a "connection refused" error when connecting to a database?
```

**To exit:** Press `Ctrl+C` twice

**What's Happening:**
- Interactive mode provides a conversational interface in the terminal
- Perfect for quick queries without opening the IDE
- Session history is maintained during the conversation
- All Bob capabilities available through natural language

> 📌 **Learn More:** [Interactive Mode Documentation](https://bob.ibm.com/docs/shell/getting-started/start-bobshell-interactive)

### Non-Interactive Mode

Execute single commands for automation and scripting:

**Create a test file first:**

```bash
# Create a simple Python file
cat > calculator.py << 'EOF'
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
EOF
```

**Now try non-interactive commands:**

```bash
# Explain code in a file
bob "Explain what calculator.py does"

# Review code
bob "Review calculator.py and suggest improvements"

# Generate new code (with auto-approval)
bob "Create a Python function that calculates factorial" --yolo --hide-intermediary-output > factorial.py

# Quick questions
bob "What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?"
```

**Key Flags:**
- `--yolo`: Auto-approve all actions (use carefully!)
- `--hide-intermediary-output`: Clean output for file redirection
- `--chat-mode <mode>`: Specify which mode to use

**What's Happening:**
- Non-interactive mode executes a single command and exits
- Perfect for automation and scripting
- Results output to stdout for easy capture
- Can be chained with other CLI tools using pipes

### Session Management

Bob automatically saves your interactive sessions for later resume:

```bash
# List available sessions
bob --list-sessions

# Resume the most recent session
bob --resume latest

# Resume a specific session by index
bob --resume 5

# Delete a session
bob --delete-session 3
```

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# Start working on a feature
bob
> Analyze myapp.js for performance issues
# Bob identifies issues...
> Suggest optimizations for the database queries
# Exit session (Ctrl+C twice)

# Later, resume to continue
bob --resume latest
> Let's implement those database optimizations now
# Bob remembers the previous context
```

**When to Use Session Resume:**
- Continue work after a break
- Maintain context across sessions
- Switch between different projects
- Return to previous explorations

### Output Redirection Best Practices

When redirecting Bob's output to files, use these approaches for clean results:

**Option 1: Use `--hide-intermediary-output` flag**
```bash
# Generate clean code files
bob "Create a sorting function in Python" --yolo --hide-intermediary-output > sort.py
```

**Option 2: Ask Bob to write the file directly**
```bash
# Bob writes the file itself
bob "Create a sorting function in Python and write it to sort.py" --yolo
```

**What Gets Included Without These:**
- Bob's thinking process
- Tool usage messages
- Status updates
- The generated code (mixed with above)

**What You Get With These:**
- Only clean, generated code
- No intermediary messages
- Ready-to-use files

### BobShell in Automation

**Example: Code Review Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# review-changes.sh - Review uncommitted changes

echo "Reviewing uncommitted changes..."
bob "Review uncommitted changes (git diff HEAD) and provide a summary" --hide-intermediary-output > review.md
echo "Review saved to review.md"
```

**Example: Batch File Processing**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# analyze-files.sh - Analyze multiple files

for file in src/*.py; do
    echo "Analyzing $file..."
    bob "Analyze $file for potential bugs and security issues" --hide-intermediary-output > "reports/$(basename $file .py)-analysis.txt"
done
```

**Example: CI/CD Integration**

```bash
# In your CI/CD pipeline
bob "Review the code changes in this PR and check for: security issues, performance problems, and code quality" --hide-intermediary-output > pr-review.md
```

### BobShell Best Practices

1. **Be Specific in Requests**
   ```bash
   # Good
   bob "Create a React component for user authentication with email/password fields, validation, and error handling"
   
   # Less specific
   bob "Create a login form"
   ```

2. **Use Appropriate Output Formats**
   ```bash
   # JSON for programmatic processing
   bob "Analyze ./src and provide results in JSON format" --hide-intermediary-output > analysis.json
   
   # Markdown for documentation
   bob "Review ./src for code quality in markdown format" --hide-intermediary-output > review.md
   ```

3. **Leverage Git Integration**
   ```bash
   # Review changes in current branch
   bob "Review code changes between main and HEAD branches"
   
   # Review uncommitted changes
   bob "Review uncommitted changes (git diff HEAD)"
   ```

> 💡 **Automatic Optimization:** Bob automatically selects the most appropriate model for each task, optimizing for both quality and cost.
